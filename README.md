# VAMPP (XAMPP on Vagrant)

Did you check out my project [`dampp`](https://github.com/cgrs/dampp)?
Well, this is the same thing, but Vagrant-powered.

## Features
* Apache 2.4 + PHP 7.0
* MariaDB 10
* phpMyAdmin 4.5
* Ubuntu 16.04 Server LTS (x64)

## Usage

```sh
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/cgrs/vampp
$ cd vampp
$ vagrant up
```

The `www/` folder is mapped to `/var/www/html/`.

## Contributing

As I stated in the other project, I'm only accepting bugfixes.
